This is a TO-DO file for turning libslab into a standalone library.
It used to be that libslab was a subdirectory of the gnome-main-menu
module, and other users like gnome-control-center would simply include
it as an svn:external.

However, with the move from Subversion to Git, and because libslab is
used by other projects anyway (like openSUSE's YaST), it is better to
have libslab as a "real" stand-alone library than as some chunk of
code that gets magically included in other projects.


=== Remove deprecated calls ===

+ libslab/app-shell-startup.[ch] has some Bonobo stuff that appears to
  be only for running the application browser as a unique app.  Remove
  this and use a more general "unique app" framework.


=== Users of libslab ===

+ Remove the libslab/ directory from gnome-main-menu, and make it use
  libslab as a stand-alone library.

+ Remove the assumption in gnome-control-center that libslab is an
  svn:external, and make it use libslab as a stand-alone library.

+ Make YaST not simply depend on an installed gnome-main-menu, and
  make it look for libslab as a stand-alone library.
